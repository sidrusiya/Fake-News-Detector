        ### Auditor Guidelines
        
        As an auditor, you play a vital role in our trusted private network. Here's what you do:
        
        - **Stake Reputation:** Stake some "reputation" to become a validator in the network.
        
        - **Block Proposal:** If chosen as a block proposing validator, select transactions for a new block. If the majority of validators (>50%) agree, the block is added, and you earn reputation.
        
        - **Voting on News:** Vote on news in incoming blocks labeled "Fake" or "True". A machine learning model provides a score (0-1) for the probability of fake news, alongside the sender's reputation.
        
        Your contributions help maintain network integrity and ensure the authenticity of shared news.
"""

readers_guidelines = """
### Guidelines for Readers:

As a reader in our network, you have the privilege to access and explore the news posted on our consortium blockchain. Here's what you can do:

1. **Anonymous Exploration:** Anonymously view news posted on the network without the need for authentication.

2. **Access Metrics:** Access essential information about news posts, including title, content, machine learning model score indicating the probability of fake news, percentage of auditors who voted the news as fake, and sender reputation.

3. **Stay Informed:** Engage with informative news content while being aware of the authenticity metrics provided.

4. **Contribute to Data Availability:** Contribute indirectly by generating data through your viewership, aiding in the creation of a more informed network environment.

    # Log of Your Reputation Changes

    This page displays the log of your reputation changes within the network. Your reputation may change due to various reasons outlined below:

    ### Reasons for Reputation Changes:

    - **Initial Reputation Allocation**:
      Upon joining the network, users receive an initial reputation value. Auditors receive a notably higher reputation than readers, following successful authentication.

    - **Broadcasting News**:
      If the majority of auditors mark news as "Fake," the broadcaster faces a penalty proportionate to their balance. Conversely, if marked "True," the broadcaster receives a balance increase, but not proportionate to their existing balance to prevent disproportionate wealth accumulation.

    - **Block Validation**:
      Auditors that voted on a news post to be “Fake”/”True” and the majority voted for the opposite are penalized by a percentage of their stake in the network.

    - **Not Proposing a Block**:
      Block proposers that fail to utilize network time by creating a new block within the allotted time period are penalized on a percentage of their stake.

    ### Reputation Change Log:

    Below is a table displaying the details of your reputation changes:
